## What I have read today:
### Material: [Visual Regression Testing in Action](https://speakerdeck.com/quramy/vrt-in-action)
- 'Real' test for view part, not a snapshot. If we've introduced it, maybe some regression we experienced can be prevented...? I thought so once, but in the case I was reminded of, componentA's visual regression is caused by componentB's update and they are offered in different repositories, so we canno test that when there are changes in componentB. It could be a good reason to adopt monorepo. (Honestly, I wasn't sure about the advantage of monorepo, so it is a big finding!)
