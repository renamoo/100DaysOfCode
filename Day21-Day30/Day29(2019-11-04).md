# Today's Theme: 

## What I have learned today:
### Material: [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-sum/problem)
- Since leetcode does not have many SQL problems, I signed up for Hacker Rank. I will focus on Aggregation for a while.

### Material: [TLS1.3](https://milestone-of-se.nesuke.com/nw-basic/tls/tls-version-1-3/)
- Current recommended version is TLS1.2. 1.3 was released in 2018.
- Biggest changes are:
1. require to use more secure encrypthon algorhythm　（AEAD. It executes authentication and encryption at once)
2. regarding the restart of session, adopt new non-vurnable process
3. change the handshake process boldly so that achieve 1-RTT (0-RTT is also possible though it is not assure forward secrecy)

### Material: [TickeToDo](https://github.com/renamoo/TickeToDo)
- I try out the ionic. Its devapp allows me to check on iOS like expo! Great.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
