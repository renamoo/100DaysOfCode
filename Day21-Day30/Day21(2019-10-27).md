# Today's Theme: React Native

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [AlarmForWorrier](https://github.com/renamoo/AlarmForWorrier)
- To do task periodically, we need backgroud processing. However, it seems background processing is not easy to achieve. Maybe I have to do eject, but once I've done it, I cannot go back. So I have to think carefully. Though I cannot assign a specific time, backgroundFetch might help resolving problem. I will try tomorrow.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
