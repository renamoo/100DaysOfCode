# Today's Theme: HTTP & RDB

## HTTP
- HTTP is a protocol to exchange **any kind of** data between client and server **based on TCP/IP.**
- ~Its features are~ **It achieves some of REST's important features:** stateless, unifined interface **and cache.**
- It has only 8 methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, ~UPDATE~ **HEAD, OPTIONS(to know the supported methods for the resource or required header fields), TRACE, CONNECT**.
- First client side send a request, server receives it and return response.
- A request and reposnse have header fields and body. 
- Here are some examples from request header fields: origin, Cache-control, referer, ~requestUrl,~ Content-type **(specify media type), Accept (for content negotiation)**
- Here are some examples from response header fields: ~status,~ Content-type, **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**
- HTTP status 1XX: **processing** , 2XX: success, 3XX:redirect , 4XX: client issues, 500: server issues.
- In ~1.0~ **1.1**, it cannot re-use the connection. So everytime interaction happens, it establish connection and close it. Of course, TCP have to do three-way handshake every single time.
- In 2.0 it is enabled to recycle the conection. So once it is established, it is kept until user close the browser.
- Though 2.0 resolves several issues in 1.0, still it has problem. For example, Head of line blocking. When one of the packets are lost, TCP automatically re-send the packet. However, application cannot start processing the packets until re-sent packet has arrived though packets for another process have arrived fully. 
- To resolve issues in HTTP 2.0, the proposal of HTTP 3.0 has been formulated. One of the biggest changes would be QUIC. QUIC is the communication protocol based on UDP, not TCP. However, it behaves like TCP. It re-send the packet if it is lost on the way but it can proceed the process if the data for that process are all arrived.

I will move on to [HTTP wrap up part2]()
