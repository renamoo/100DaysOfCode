# Today's Theme: Browser
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [How browser renders](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)
- **raw bytes => character => token** => node => DOM / **CSSOM**
- DOM + CSSOM => Render Tree! (only visible element) => Layout (calculation) => Paint => pixels (Critical Rendering Path) => Composition (GPU process pixels)
- CSS Cascade is defining the specificity. It depends on three points: **Where css comes from, selector, and location**
- DOM is the interface to interact between JS and HTML
- When browser engine come across scriopt tag, it stops rendering process because JS can alter DOM structure. 
- JS also can access to CSSOM like node.style.XXX... and when it does and CSSOM is not ready, JS execution will be haulted.
- However, `<script async ...>` does not stop rendering.

### Material: [Critical Rendering Path](https://coliss.com/articles/build-websites/operation/work/about-the-critical-rendering-path.html)
- CSS is Rendering Blocking Resource (need CSSOM to render) and Script Blocking Resource
- JS is Parser Blocking Resource

### Material: [Shadow DOM](https://kuroeveryday.blogspot.com/2018/11/how-to-create-virtual-dom-framework.html)
- Now I know the basic of the rendering and finally I can get the idea of shadow DOM! Wow.
- Shadow DOM is not any API or function. It is just a JS Object like JSON.
- Framework keep Shadow DOM Object as 1:1 relationship to real DOM.
- When the state is updated, it calculate the diff of sdhadow DOM and only related part is updated in the real DOM.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
