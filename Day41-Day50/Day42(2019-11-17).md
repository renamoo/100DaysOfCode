## Today's theme: Browser

### Material: [Toy Browser Engine](https://github.com/renamoo/toy-browser-engine)
- Today I added layout tree builder (calculating the position is complicated though it is a toy!) and I read about rasterization (Painting). Since painting seems to take longer time to introduce library to draw, I only did read it. In that process, the engine walk through the layout tree and make the commands list to paint and then, it convert data to pixcels and the view will be appear!
