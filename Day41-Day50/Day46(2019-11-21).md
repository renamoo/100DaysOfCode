# Today's Theme: Linux & DB
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Linuxの仕組み]()
- OS provides wrapper function to do system call. Thanks to it, highend language does not have to write assembly code to do that.
- There are two process management system call. One is fork() and the other one is execve(). fork() make the different process which shares the memoy at first. execve() oveeride the current process and replace with new one.
- Linux kernel has process scheduler to allocate the CPU. 
- With demand paging, it first assure the virtual memory whish is not associated with real memory at that point. Then, when process actually call for the memory, it allocate the resource. 
- (Large)(Slow)  Storage -> Memory -> Cache memory -> Register (Small)(Fast)
- When process access to file, it will be loaded to cache memory and register. When changes is made in register, it apply that changes to data in cache memory. Then, it is marked as dirty and applied to storage later.
- File system store the data with metadata in tree structure. It has two strategies to avoid inconsistency: Journaling (logging first) and Copy on Write (make copy, add changes to it and delete the original). However, they are not perfect.


## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
