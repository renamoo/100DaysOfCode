# Today's Theme: Browser
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [How Browsers work](https://www.html5rocks.com/ja/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/)
- loading => HTML / CSS Parser (tokenizer and analyzer) => DOM Tree / Rules => StyleTree => Layout Tree => layout (calculating the position, width and attributes) => Painting => pixels.
- CSS is described in context free grammer. It is shown in BNF style. On the other hand, HTML is not. 
- Root of the DOM tree is document and that of rules is stylesheet.
- Invisible elements like head or element which is set as display:none does not appear in DOM tree.
- When match the style to node, first it search the style map using the rightest selector as a key. Then, check the selector in the left matches that node. Therefore, browser interpret the style from the right side!!
- There are two types of layout. One is global and the other one is incremental. Global occurs when style change related to global occurs such as font size. It also happens when the scroll size is changed. Incremental is partial updates.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
