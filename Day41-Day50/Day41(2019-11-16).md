# Today's Theme: 

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Toy Browser Engine](https://github.com/renamoo/toy-browser-engine)
- Build a toy browser engine. It helps myself understainding how browser engine works.
- It is interesting that while HTML unconventional parser fills in the gap, CSS conventional parser just throw away nonsense part. 
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [DNS Root Server](https://www.nic.ad.jp/ja/newsletter/No45/0800.html)
- It is the origin of tree structure of DNS servers.
- It has the information of servers name and IP which manage TLS (Top level domain)'s record.
- DNSSEC gives digital sign to DNS record and assure its correctness.


### Material: [Compression](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/compression)
- Accept-Encoding header shows what type of compressed data client can handle. Then, server choose one of them and return data with Content-Encoding header. Sometimes Content-type header is used to show what kind of data is served with MIME type.
- gzip is most widely used way of compression. (For about 80%, out of all compressed request) Brotli ranks in the second.
- If you are the one who will publish the content, at least you should use gzip. If you can handle br and precompression, you should adopt brotli lv11. Since brotli takes a time to compress compared to gzip, if you cannot use precompression, you should use brotli lv6. Br lv6 offers more effective compression than gzip but only takes the same amount of time.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
