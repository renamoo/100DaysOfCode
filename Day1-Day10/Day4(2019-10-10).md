# Today's Theme: Writing Efficient Queries

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/writing-efficient-queries)
Factors which make insufficient queries:
- JOIN
- N:N merge
- Text column (tends to be large data size)
- recurring calculation

Dropping unneccesary data with subquery works well when the original table is huge.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [MicroChallenges](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/microchallenges)
