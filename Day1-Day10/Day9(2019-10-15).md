# Today's Theme: 

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
- Finally I start take a first step to competition. Since my purpose is to try analytical SQL, Tried to use SQL, select data and analyze, but it is not easy. I might have thought too complex, because when I put very extreme data which return survived if age is between 17 to 19, the accuracy was about 49%. It was surprising.
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Inside Browser Part4](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part4)
### Material: [Passive Event Listeners によるスクロールの改善](https://blog.jxck.io/entries/2016-06-09/passive-event-listeners.html)
- New things to me is that events like mousemove has already delayed and coaleased before we catch the event. Also, developer can get the every single event if they want. For example, it matters when they develop drawning app.
- Also, it is also a new thing that event handler can prevent user from scrolling with event.preventDefault() and because of that, it is recommended to set `{ passive: true }` when it is a passive eventListener.
- `{ passive: true }` means that it does not call `evebt.preventDefault()` and compositor can proceed the scell event handling

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [continue Titanic]()
