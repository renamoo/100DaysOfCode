# Today's Theme: 

## What I have done today: 

### Material: [Department Top Three Salaries](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries)

Since today I ate out for dinner and I don't have much time to do Kaggle, I did some practices instead.
I solved this problem using `DENSE_RANK`. It seems not so bad as fas as I read some discussions.
However, solution seems more simple. 
The bottom line is to take "ranked 1st, 2nd or 3rd" as "there are no more than three values higer than current value". 
I might have trapped in the same thing once before. so I'd like to use it next time.
    
### Material: [not-boring-movies](https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/)
This one is selected by Random. It is very simple and easy :)

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [writing-efficient-queries](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/writing-efficient-queries)
