# Today's Theme: GCP

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Setup remote startup script](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1735?parent=catalog)
- Challenge lab is more fun than usual lab just following the steps.
- To set the remote script as a startup script, you should set url for custom metadata.
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [What is Network Interface](https://qiita.com/takahiro_tnk/items/c500a4d915562cca28e7)
- IP address is given to network interface not to host.

## Tomorrow
