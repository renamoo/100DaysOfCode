# Today's Theme: GCP

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1738?parent=catalog)
- To build image, use `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io(region)/(projectId)/(appname):(tag) .`
- `.` means you have Dockerfile in your current directory.
- After creating cluster and deploying app, I have to expose it to make it accesible from outside.
- Yaay, got a 100!
