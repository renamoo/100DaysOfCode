# Today's Theme: Firebase & GCP

Continuence to yersterday, I still work on firebase authentication. To me, guide was not so fully easy to understand. Until I tried to initialize firebase app, it was good...
    
## What I have watched today:
### Material: [安心してGCPを使うための処方箋](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/cloud-onair-japan-q3-2019/watch?talk=tky_apg_q4&reg=)
- When I activate MFA for my account, I wondered why Gmail is app is automatically chosen to authenticate. We have ohter Google Apps like Chrome. In this Cloud OnAir, I learned that Google private account is associated with gmail address. Then I figured out why.
- Also, it is found that it is possible to create own domain address with private account. (It is not recommended, though)
- Google enterprise accound have one organization. Under that, we can create teams. However, it is not also recommended to create teams corresponding to real organization map. It should be divided based on authority or roles that group should have.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
