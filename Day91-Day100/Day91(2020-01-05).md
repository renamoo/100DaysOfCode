# Today's Theme: GCP & k8s

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Securely Expose a SOAP Service as a RESTful API Using Apigee](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/4163?parent=catalog)
- Apigee Edge's dashboard is very simple and modern, I'm a little surprised.
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [数時間で完全理解！わりとゴツいKubernetesハンズオン！！](https://qiita.com/Kta-M/items/ce475c0063d3d3f36d5d#kubernetes%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AB%E5%A4%89%E6%8F%9B%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E3%81%BF%E3%82%88%E3%81%86)
- Cluster includes master and nodes
- Node is a server where app is running
- Master control and monitor nodes

### Material: [知ると便利なヒアドキュメント](https://qiita.com/kite_999/items/e77fb521fc39454244e7)
- I wondered what was `cat << EOF > filename` I've seen recently. 
- It allows us to create file which include multiple lines.
- `EOF` can be replaced to any string.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
