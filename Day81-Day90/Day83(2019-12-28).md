# Today's Theme: GCP & JS

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Creating a Virtual Machine](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/3563?parent=catalog)
- `gcloud compute instances create` allows you to set up instance. It can be achieved also from console of course.

### Material: [Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/563?parent=catalog)
- `export XXX=something` defines variable which you can use like `$XXX`
- 
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [anyc/await](https://qiita.com/soarflat/items/1a9613e023200bbebcb3)
- Working on [this issue](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury/issues/257), I searched about async/await.
- It might be much simpler than RxJS
- await is used in the async function and when it called, it pause the operation untill reject or resolve is called.

- fs-extra library offers extra method for fs module.
- Made a pull request!

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [GCP & JS]()
