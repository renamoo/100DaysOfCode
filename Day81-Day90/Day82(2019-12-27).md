# Today's Theme: GCP

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [GCP Essentials](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/23?utm_source=gcp-free-trial-2&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=19nt2&qlcampaign=1c-nft-988)
- I can use terminal without leaving GCP console. Looks fabulous.
- So many functions, but it seems relatively easy to see.
- Basic concept of IAM or role sounds common to AWS.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
