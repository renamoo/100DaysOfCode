# Today's Theme: GCP

## What I have learned today:
### Material:[Cloud Storage: Qwik Start - Console](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1760?parent=catalog)
- Basic function is not so different from AWS, I thought.

### Material:[Cloud IAM: Qwik Start](https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/551?parent=catalog)
- If not specified, access level is applied to all GCP Services.
- For example, if we choose Object Storage Viewer from roles, it allows readonly access only to Storage.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
