# Today's Theme: 

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/renamoo/blackjack-microchallenge)
- Actually, it was not algorythm. It is about logic and probability.
- It is interesting that percentage never get higher than 50%.

### Material: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/human-traffic-of-stadium/solution/)
- It is not so difficult, but I just thought how to make conditions well controled with IF/ELSE but just using OR solves all of this. Relax...I have to try this one more time.
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Inside look at modern web browser (part 1)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1)
- Contrast with CPU, GPU handles the simple tasks related to graphics. It can work across multiple CPU cores at once. Recently more and more computation can be executed on GPU.
- Different processes can interact with each other using IPC(Inter Process Communications). 
- Currently, Chrome assign processes for each site including iframe. 
- Renderer handles anything inside of tab. Contrary, GPU handles whole screen.
- Basically it break down one operation to multiple processes but when memory resource is nout enough it can combine some of them. It is flexible.
- Site Isolation runs different renderer for website in iframe and parent website of irame. It is importnant when thiking about security: Cross Origin Policy. Therefore, when I open devtool for page with iframe, it shows information from several different renderers. Wow!
