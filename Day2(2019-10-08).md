# Today's Theme: SQL for nested and repeated data

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/nested-and-repeated-data)

### Nested Data
Several columns can be packed into one column.  
In that case, yoiu can extract the data in that column like accessing the object.

### Repeated Data
Several values can be packed into one column.
In this case, it is stored as array. To unfold this column, you need to add 
`UNNEST(columnName) AS alias` in FROM.

Both can be used at once. (It means, nested and repeated data are possible)
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Load Balancing at Front end](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/load-balancing-frontend/)
Yesterday, I read this article and there are several words I am not familiar with. Therefore, as a follow-up, I did some research.

### [GRE (Generic Routing Encupsalation)](http://kazunetproject.site/2804/)
### [EDNS0](https://jprs.jp/related-info/guide/008.pdf)
DNS has been limited the message size to 512 byte to send only one packet with UDP. However, technology has progressed and more and more need come up to send larger data. To tackle this problem, expanded system is developed. This is EDNS0. 
### [Consistent Hashing](https://www.slideshare.net/paulowniaceae/consistent-hash)
With this method, node is assigned automatically and evenly. It also automatically re-assign the node even one node fails. 

## What I have read today2:
### Material: プログラムはなぜ動くのか

- Today I learned the composition of CPU. Basically, it has calculation, clock, controller and register. Clock tells CPU the timing to handle commands. Calculation do the calculation and controller execute the commands. The most important thing is register. It saves the data and commands.
- Every one byte, register has address. It goes back and forth in this address when the function is executed. In that case, it save the return address to stack. Wow, stack plays a very big role in computer!
- There are several types of register. For example, there are registers used as a pair. Base register record the base address of array and index register save the all items in array.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [Efficient Queries](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/writing-efficient-queries)
