# Today's Theme: Handling the data

## What I have learned today:

- We have to pre-process "categorical values" before starting machiene learning. There are several options. One is, as the same as in missing values, just dropping the column which has categorical values. As you can imagine, in this case too, this is most likely to achive the worse. The second way is converting categorical values to numeric values. It is useful when these values acan be interpreted as number. I mean, each category has several weights such as S, M, L sizes. However, not all these values has different weights. Let's think about the dat of week. Monday and Friday are equal. In this case, hot encoding is used. It creates as many columns as the variety of categorical values. Then, set 1 for column of the value for that row. It can property handle flat categorical values, but it add data of the number of possible values * row number. Therefore, if the number of possible values go up, it is not recommended. It is in most cases, performs best. Last thing, what we have to care about is the possibility that values which did not show up in train data can be appear in test data.

- Using a pipeline allows us to do such preprocessing and predicting much easier.

- Workflow handles the several pipeline together and manage their status or dependencies.
