# Today's Theme: 

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Titanic]()
- Since there are large difference for the rate of survival in the vview of Fare, I added Fare condition as OR. The accuracy goes up tp 6.6. Now I did not do any new things (because base SQL is the same), so I will move on to another course from tomorrow.
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Big Data Modeling and Management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-management/home/welcome)
- The process of handling big data is very similar that the way of machine leaening. For example, the article I read before about Kaggle Titanic problem, first check what part of data is missing and adjust the data lacked. It is also required for big data hadling. First we have to observe the data before processing it.
- The thing is to think about the goal. Just collecting the data as much as I can does not produce anything. How to select and process data is crucial.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [Missing Value](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/missing-values)
