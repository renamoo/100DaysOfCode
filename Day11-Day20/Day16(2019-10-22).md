# Today's Theme: Big Data

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Data Leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/data-leakage)
- When we make a model, we have to care about data leakage. It happens due to the inappropriate selection of data or pre-procrssing. Basically there are two pattern. One is taregt leakage. It is about whether one data is available when we apply the model to prediction target. If not, we should not use that data. Also, we have to care about how one data is calculated. If it is not clear, we should not use that. The other one is test-train contamination. If the test data is used to create the model, it is meaningless.
