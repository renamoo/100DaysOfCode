# Today's Theme: React Native & HTTP

## What I have learned today:
### Material: []()
- Today I feel like to try creating alarm app for myself. I thought, to do that, I have to access to Native API, so I checked ionic and React Native. Different from what I expected, it seems native alarm is not common. So, I started from Notification. I could successfully show notfication, but stil I'm not sure how to automatically launch app.
- WHat I was surprised at most is how useful expo is. I thought if we could used that when we developing health care app, how it might have been smooth.
