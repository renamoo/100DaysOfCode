# Today's Theme: Analytical SQL

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/analytic-functions)

There are three types for analytical functions for SQL
1) Aggregational functions: AVG, MIX/MAX, SUM, COUNT
2) Analytic Navigation Functions: FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE, LEAD/LAG  
I want know why it is named as LAG, since I don't have any idea for original word, it is hard to remember :(  
Anyway, we can use it like LAG(columnName, 1)
3) Analytic Numbering functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK

With Over, you can specify what data should be used in calculation.
In Over, there are three optional parts.
1) PARTITION BY : Partitioning the table
2) ORDER BY
3) Window Frame: Based on which data calculation should be done.  
  example:  
    `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` : 3 rows before and current row  
    `ROWS BETWEEN 15 PRECEEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING` : 15 rows before, current row and following 15 row  
    `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` : all data in table  
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Load Balancing at Front end](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/load-balancing-frontend/)
- It is always not a good idea to rely on single resource because physical bottleneck cannot be removed completely
- To do load balancing, you have to think about the "optimal" way
- However,there is no single answer because what is the best "optimal" way varies depending on glibal(internet) vs local(inside datacenter), hardware/software, nature of traffic
- For example, in search query, latency is the most important. On the other hand, for the video upload, throughput is the most important.
- Taken DNS As an example, though DNS is implemented by the simplest and most efficient way, there are still room to be optimized more.
- It should move on to the level of taking advantage of virtual IP adresses.
- VIPs are the IP addresses not assigned to particular device. Therefore, how many devices is behind the VIPS or updating the machined behind VIPS will not be known by users.
- VIPs'most important device of implementation is network load balancer. It forwards the request to backend machines.
- Several approcahes can be considered: simply forwarding to the least busiest machine. But it does not work when it is stateful. Then, think about issuing the connection id or hash cide to distinguish context.
- But it also fails when there is an incident. Still there is an alternative. It is called consistent hashing. It is durable when the number of machine changes dynamically.
- Returning to the larger question: how network balancer should forward requests. Network Address Transiton requires us to track every single connection. So let's take another way.
- Modifying data link layer to achievet Direct Server Reponse. It save the load for network balancer, but it needs all datalink layeres are reachable. So it won't scale.
- Then, now packet encupsalation is adopted, though still it takes a little price.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [Nested and Repeated Data](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/nested-and-repeated-data)
