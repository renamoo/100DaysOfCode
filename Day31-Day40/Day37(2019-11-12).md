# Today's Theme: Security of Browser
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Safe and Secure](https://web.dev/secure/)
- There are two types of attacks: active attacks and passive attacks. For example, data manupilation by middleman is active attack and data leakage by middleman is passive attacks.
- Browser is a sandbox. It does not have power outside of a brwoser. It is one way of defense.
- Not allowing the access to the resource from another origin is also one way of defense.
- However, there are cases that we should allow that like public API. CORS headers resolve this issue.

### Material: [IPv6](https://www.nic.ad.jp/ja/newsletter/No20/sec0700.html)
- There are 3 major differences between Ipv6 and Ipv4.
1. much number of global address
2. it equieps security system as default
3. easy for end user to set up

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
