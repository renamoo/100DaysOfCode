# Today's Theme: HTTP & Go

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [はじめてのHTTP](https://booth.pm/ja/items/1043596)
- Continue from yesterday. I did Hello, wold with Go.
- What I did is uploaded to [http2-go](https://github.com/renamoo/http2-go)
- Error hanling go sounds new to me. It does not have try~catch.
- I think I could deepen my understanding for HTTP2 especially about frames and streams.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [Reading 10minutes-IT](https://www.nic.ad.jp/ja/newsletter/10minute.html)
