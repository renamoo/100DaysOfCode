# Today's Theme: HTTP & Go

## What I have learned today:

### Material: [はじめてのHTTP](https://booth.pm/ja/items/1043596)
- Thought is it not a first time for me to learn about HTTP, I haven't learned with actually doing something so I chose this book to finalize findings. It was a very first time for me to write Go.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to [はじめてのHTTP](https://booth.pm/ja/items/1043596)
