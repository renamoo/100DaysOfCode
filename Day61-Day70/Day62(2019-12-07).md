## What I have read today:
### Material: [import in Deno](https://blog.leko.jp/post/package-management-in-deno-with-import-map/)
- Deno imports packages by specifying the url by default. It does not require package manager like npm or yarn so imports are downloaded dynamically. However, it can cause trouble because if developer use the same package in several places, they have to write url many times and it makes it hard to update the source url. So some people are trying to develop manager.
- However, author think if he can make the best of import map deno supports, we can maintain deno code without specifying the url and untroduing third party.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
