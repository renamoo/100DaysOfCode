# Today's Theme: WASM

Today I joined WebHackMeetups which features WebAssembly.
[Here is the summary](https://hackmd.io/@WebHack/H1ejVCB6r/%2FkVaHJV64QDyu-XAdNaGGUQ).
What I was surprised at is the difference between the browser.
In Chrome, since V8 is very sophisticated engine, JS program and WASM program does not make such a big difference in performance. Its about 30% WASM is fast. However, in Safari it makes a big difference.  
Also, since WASM code becomes binary, its module is compact.  
THe reason why WASM is fast is it does not require parsing. Usually, JS is parsed and interpreted to AST, but WASM directly generate AST so it can save the time to parse.

Also, there was a short talk about WebComponents. I think in this session, I gained a better understanding of web components. I'm just curious ShadowDOM mentioned here is the same ShadowDOM mentioned in the expalanation of React. I assume it is not because what Devtool's Elements tab shows is very different.

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
