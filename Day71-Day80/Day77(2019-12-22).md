# Today's Theme: React & CSS

- Made a [Pull Request](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-treasury/pull/324)
- It took me more than 30 mins because I was trapped by git history...
- I learned to be sure to pull upstream periodically
- I searched but still do not understand the advantage of this model fully.
- gets merged! :)

- From the trending page, I found [repository of React Native Game App](https://www.ordinarypuzzles.com/).
- Its official page is so cool. It shows overview in the left side and show a little game panel in the right-bottom.
- Seems good idea...!
    
## What I have read today:
### Material: [Purge CSS](https://www.purgecss.com/)
- It can remove unused css

## Tomorrow
I will move on to []()
